	<p>Following the Manchester Arena bombing at Grande's Dangerous Woman Tour show in May 2017, the singer became reluctant to record new music, preferring to spend time with her loved ones because of the emotional impact the tour had on her.[1] She returned to the studio in late 2017, writing "No Tears Left to Cry" with Savan Kotecha and its producers Max Martin and Ilya. Regarding the song, Grande said she hopes it brings light and comfort, "but also makes you wanna dance and live ya best life!"</p>
